This is a simple java implementation of a card library. The library is a project that depends on maven to build and uses testng for testing.

Running "mvn install" will run all tests and generate a jar file card-deck-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar that can be used to be linked into other projects.

Run "mvn test" to just run the tests.
